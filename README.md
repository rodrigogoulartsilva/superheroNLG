# superheroNLG

I love comic books so I decided to work on this small pet project for me to practice Natural Language Generation using Deep Learning in Python:

1- Web scraping https://www.superherodb.com for Superheroes' names, bio and powers

2- Training a Keras LSTM model to predict the next letter based of the previous 3 letters from superheroes names

3- Randomly generating superhero names from a random seed.

These are some funny/interesting names generated by the model:
- You shall be called: Raven Goblin
- You shall be called: Onslaugherman
- You shall be called: Curser Girl
- You shall be called: Air-Woman
- You shall be called: Fightning
- You shall be called: Cycorpionic
- You shall be called: Doctorman
- You shall be called: Dragirl
- You shall be called: Speedye
- You shall be called: Queen Goblin
